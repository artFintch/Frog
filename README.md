Tiny utility for read and write file line by line in Swift. I wrote this for easier work with files in some algorithms implementations. In some cases read and write line by line in Swift take a lot of part of an implementation ðŸ˜Ÿ.
- Automatically closing a file after `deinit` a frog;
- You don't need to work with pointers explicitly;
- Read and write line by line in one line.

###### Read:
```swift
let path = "path/to/your/file"
let input = Frog(path)

if let newLine = input.readLine() {
  print(newLine)
}
```
###### Write:
```swift
let path = "path/to/your/file"
let output = Frog(path, mode: .w)
output.write(line: "Croak-croak")
```
